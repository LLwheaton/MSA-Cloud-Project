# MSA Cloud Project

SimTracker.py simulates a health tracker. It tracks a person's heart rate and blood pressure over time. The data is sent to the cloud using Azure IoT Hub and Stream Analytics jobs. It is also sent to Power BI to visualise the data in a report. 


Code source: SimulatedDevice.py in the sample project folder
